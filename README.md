Placement Prediction ML Model (Flask Deployment)-

This machine learning model predicts whether a student will be placed based on their IQ, CGPA, and profile skills.
It uses a supervised learning algorithm—such as logistic regression or decision trees—trained on historical student placement data. 
Once trained, the model is integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to input student data through a simple web form.
The backend processes the inputs, runs the prediction, and displays whether the student is likely to be placed or not. 
This tool provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for real-time placement predictions.
